    "## Basic Algebraic Structures\n",
    "\n",
    "### Abelian Groups\n",
    "\n",
    "Any algebraic structure is defined through a set and an operation. An Abelian Group (also known as commutative group) $\\mathbb{G}$ is a tuple $(G,\\oplus)$ where $G$ is a set and $\\oplus$ is a binary operation (i.e. an operation that takes two elements of the set and returns another element) that satisfies the following properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Closure: $\\forall a,b\\in G, a\\oplus b\\in G$ (the elements returned by the operation are elements of the set).\n",
    "- Associativity: $\\forall a,b,c\\in G, (a\\oplus b)\\oplus c=a\\oplus(b\\oplus c)$\n",
    "- Identity element: $\\exists e\\in G, \\forall a\\in G, a\\oplus e=e\\oplus a=a$. $e$ is called the identity element. Sometimes it is also denoted by a **bold** \"one\": $\\boldsymbol{1}$\n",
    "- Inverse element: $\\forall a\\in G, \\exists a^{-1}\\in G, a\\oplus a^{-1}=a^{-1}\\oplus a=e$. $a^{-1}$ is called the inverse element of $a$.\n",
    "- Commutativity: $\\forall a,b\\in G, a\\oplus b=b\\oplus a$\n",
    "\n",
    "_(Note that the symbol $\\forall$ means \"for all\" and $\\exists$ means \"there exists\")_\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of Abelian Groups:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The set of integers $\\mathbb{Z}$ with the binary operation $+$ (addition) is an Abelian Group. The identity element is $0$ and the inverse element of $a$ is $-a$.\n",
    "- The set of integers $\\mathbb{Z}$ with the binary operation $\\cdot$ (product; multiplication) is **NOT** an Abelian Group. The identity element is $1$ but the inverse element of $a$ is $\\frac{1}{a}$, which is NOT an element of $\\mathbb{Z}$.\n",
    "- The set of rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$ with the binary operation $\\cdot$ (product; multiplication) is an Abelian Group. The identity element is $1$ and the inverse element of $a$ is $\\frac{1}{a}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the commutativity property is not present in the Abelian Group, then it is just called a Group.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Finite Groups, Group Order, Cyclic Groups and Generators\n",
    "\n",
    "If the Abelian Groups $G$ is finite, then we call it a Finite Group. The number of elements in the group $\\mathbb{G}$ is called the order of the group, and is usually denoted by $\\left|\\mathbb{G}\\right|$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: The set of integers $\\{0,1,2,3,4\\}$ (which is a finite set) and the binary operation $+$. This is not a Finite Group because we lack **closure**: if we perform $2 + 3 = 5$, and $5$ is not in the set. However, if we change $+$ for $+$ under modulo $5$, then we do get a Finite Group, because this time $2 + 3 = 5\\equiv 0\\quad\\text{mod}~5$. Indeed, all groups $(\\mathbb{Z}_n, +~\\text{mod}~ n)$ are finite (abelian) groups, whose order is $n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Cyclic Group is a group that can be generated by a single element, called **generator** by means of the binary operation. Example, $\\mathbb{Z}$ with the binary operation addition $+$ is indeed an infinite cyclic group, which has two different generators: $1$ and $-1$, because every integer can be generated by adding $1$ or $-1$ to itself, or through their inverses.\n",
    "\n",
    "The same happens with $\\mathbb{Z}_n$ with the binary operation addition $+$ under modulo $n$. Example, $\\mathbb{Z}_5$ has four generators: $1$, $2$, $3$ and $4$, because every element of $\\mathbb{Z}_5$ can be generated by adding $1$ or $4$ to itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Exponential Map\n",
    "\n",
    "Say we have a finite cyclic group $\\mathbb{G}=(G,\\oplus)$ of order $n$ ($\\left|\\mathbb{G}\\right|=n$; it contains $n$ elements) whose generator is $g$. The exponential map is a function that takes an integer $a\\in\\mathbb{Z}_n$ and returns the element of the group that is generated by $g^a$. One can understand $g^a$ as applying $a$ times the $\\oplus$ operation on $g$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example: take the finite cyclic abelian group $\\mathbb{G}:=(\\mathbb{Z}_5, +~\\text{mod}~5)$ of order $5$, and let's choose the generator $2$. The exponential map, which we'll call $\\xi$ is:\n",

    "### Pairings\n",
    "\n",
    "A pairing map takes elements from a group $\\mathbb{G}_1$ and elements from a group $\\mathbb{G}_2$ and returns an element of a group $\\mathbb{G}_T$. Let's define the pairing $e$, and a pair $(a,b)\\mid a\\in\\mathbb{G_1}, b\\in\\mathbb{G}_2$:\n",

    "\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "e(g_1\\oplus g'_1,g_2) &= e(g_1,g_2)\\oplus e(g'_1,g_2)\\\\\n",

    "In other words, if the pairing of two elements of $\\mathbb{G}_1$ and $\\mathbb{G}_2$ is the neutral element of $\\mathbb{G}_T$, then at least one of the elements of $\\mathbb{G}_1$ or $\\mathbb{G}_2$ must be the neutral element of their respective group.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example for a pairing is taking all the groups as the set of integers $\\mathbb{Z}_p$ with the binary operation addition $+$ and the pairing $e$ as:\n",

    "### Rings\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be focusing on something more specifically called commutative rings. A Ring $R$ is a tuple $(R,\\oplus,\\otimes)$ where $R$ is a set and $\\oplus$ and $\\otimes$ are binary operations that satisfy the following properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $(R,\\oplus)$ is an Abelian Group\n",

    "- Distributivity: $\\forall a,b,c\\in R, (a\\oplus b)\\otimes c=(a\\otimes c)\\oplus(b\\otimes c)$\n",
    "- Identity element: $\\exists e\\in R, \\forall a\\in R, a\\otimes e=e\\otimes a=a$. $e$ is called the identity element. Sometimes it is also denoted by a **bold** \"one\": $\\boldsymbol{1}$. In this case, the identity element for $\\oplus$ can be denoted by a **bold** \"zero\": $\\boldsymbol{0}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example, the set of integers $\\mathbb{Z}$ with the binary operations $+$ (addition) and $\\cdot$ (product; multiplication) is a Ring. The identity element for $+$ is $0$ and the identity element for $\\cdot$ is $1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fields & Galois Fields\n",
    "\n",
    "The final algebraic structure we'll see are Fields. A Field $\\mathbb{F}$ is a tuple $(F,\\oplus,\\otimes)$ where $F$ is a set and $\\oplus$ and $\\otimes$ are binary operations that satisfy the following properties:\n",

    "Galois Fields (also known as Finite Fields) are a special kind of Field, where the set $F$ is finite. The order of the field is the number of elements in the set $F$, and is usually denoted by $\\left|\\mathbb{F}\\right|$. We are going to use what are known as Prime Fields, which are build by means of $\\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z}$ with the binary operations $+$ (addition) and $\\cdot$ (product; multiplication) under modulo $p$, where $p\\in\\mathbb{P}$. These special fields are denoted as $\\mathbb{F}_p$.\n",

    "In that case, we would have a Ring, but not a Field, because not every arbitrary element of $a\\in\\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}\\setminus\\{0\\}$ has an inverse $a^{-1}$ in the set.

    "## Polynomials\n",
    "\n",
    "A polynomial is an expression consisting of variables (also called indeterminates) and coefficients, that involves only the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and non-negative integer exponents of variables. An example of a polynomial of a single indeterminate $x$ is $x^2 - 4x + 7$. When talking about polynomials, one refers to the set of polynomials with coefficients and values that \"live\" in the field of real numbers $\\mathbb{R}$ (embeded with the binary operations $+$ (addition) and $\\cdot$ (product; multiplication)). This set is denoted as $\\mathbb{R}[x]$. For example, the polynomial $x^2 - 2$ is an element of $\\mathbb{R}[x]$.\n",

    "We can define polynomials over any field $\\mathbb{F}$, and denote the set of polynomials with coefficients and values that \"live\" in $\\mathbb{F}$ as $\\mathbb{F}[x]$. For example, the polynomial $x^2 - 2$ is also an element of $\\mathbb{F}_5[x]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The field over which we construct the polynomials greatly affects the properties of the polynomials. Example, let's take the polynomial $x^2 - 2$.\n",
    "- If we are working with $\\mathbb{R}[x]$, then this polynomial has two roots: $\\sqrt{2}$ and $-\\sqrt{2}$, because $x^2 - 2 = (x - \\sqrt{2})(x + \\sqrt{2})$.\n",

    "Another example: the polynomial $x^2 + 1$.\n",
    "- If we are working with $\\mathbb{R}[x]$, then this polynomial has no roots, because $x^2 + 1 = (x + i)(x - i)$, where $i$ is the imaginary unit, and $i$ is not an element of $\\mathbb{R}$.\n",
    "- If we are working with $\\mathbb{C}[x]$, then this polynomial has two roots: $\\pm i$.\n",
    "- If we are working with $\\mathbb{F}_5[x]$, then this polynomial has two roots: $2$ and $3$, because $x^2 + 1 = (x - 2)(x - 3)$.\n",
