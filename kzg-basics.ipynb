An Abelian Group (also known as commutative group) $\\mathbb{G}$ is a tuple $(G,\\oplus)$ where $G$ is a set and $\\oplus$ is a binary operation (i.e. an operation that takes two elements of the set and returns another element) that satisfies the following properties:\n\n- Closure: $\\forall a,b\\in G, a\\oplus b\\in G$ (the elements returned by the operation are elements of the set).\n- Associativity: $\\forall a,b,c\\in G, (a\\oplus b)\\oplus c=a\\oplus(b\\oplus c)$\n- Identity element: $\\exists e\\in G, \\forall a\\in G, a\\oplus e=e\\oplus a=a$. $e$ is called the identity element. Sometimes it is also denoted by a **bold** \"one\": $\\boldsymbol{1}$\n- Inverse element: $\\forall a\\in G, \\exists a^{-1}\\in G, a\\oplus a^{-1}=a^{-1}\\oplus a=e$. $a^{-1}$ is called the inverse element of $a$.\n- Commutativity: $\\forall a,b\\in G, a\\oplus b=b\\oplus a$\n\n_(Note that the symbol $\\forall$ means \"for all\" and $\\exists$ means \"there exists\")_\n\n\nExamples of Abelian Groups:\n\n- The set of integers $\\mathbb{Z}$ with the binary operation $+$ (addition) is an Abelian Group. The identity element is $0$ and the inverse element of $a$ is $-a$.\n- The set of integers $\\mathbb{Z}$ with the binary operation $\\cdot$ (product; multiplication) is **NOT** an Abelian Group. The identity element is $1$ but the inverse element of $a$ is $\\frac{1}{a}$, which is NOT an element of $\\mathbb{Z}$.\n- The set of rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$ with the binary operation $\\cdot$ (product; multiplication) is an Abelian Group. The identity element is $1$ and the inverse element of $a$ is $\\frac{1}{a}$.\n\nIf the commutativity property is not present in the Abelian Group, then it is just called a Group.\n\n### Finite Groups, Group Order, Cyclic Groups and Generators\n\nIf the Abelian Groups $G$ is finite, then we call it a Finite Group. The number of elements in the group $\\mathbb{G}$ is called the order of the group, and is usually denoted by $\\left|\\mathbb{G}\\right|$.\n\nExample: The set of integers $\\{0,1,2,3,4\\}$ (which is a finite set) and the binary operation $+$. This is not a Finite Group because we lack **closure**: if we perform $2 + 3 = 5$, and $5$ is not in the set. However, if we change $+$ for $+$ under modulo $5$, then we do get a Finite Group, because this time $2 + 3 = 5\\equiv 0\\quad\\text{mod}~5$. Indeed, all groups $(\\mathbb{Z}_n, +~\\text{mod}~ n)$ are finite (abelian) groups, whose order is $n$.\n\nA Cyclic Group is a group that can be generated by a single element, called **generator** by means of the binary operation. Example, $\\mathbb{Z}$ with the binary operation addition $+$ is indeed an infinite cyclic group, which has two different generators: $1$ and $-1$, because every integer can be generated by adding $1$ or $-1$ to itself, or through their inverses.\n\nThe same happens with $\\mathbb{Z}_n$ with the binary operation addition $+$ under modulo $n$. Example, $\\mathbb{Z}_5$ has four generators: $1$, $2$, $3$ and $4$, because every element of $\\mathbb{Z}_5$ can be generated by adding $1$ or $4$ to itself.\n\n### The Exponential Map\n\nSay we have a finite cyclic group $\\mathbb{G}=(G,\\oplus)$ of order $n$ ($\\left|\\mathbb{G}\\right|=n$; it contains $n$ elements) whose generator is $g$. The exponential map is a function that takes an integer $a\\in\\mathbb{Z}_n$ and returns the element of the group that is generated by $g^a$. One can understand $g^a$ as applying $a$ times the $\\oplus$ operation on $g$.\n\nFor example: take the finite cyclic abelian group $\\mathbb{G}:=(\\mathbb{Z}_5, +~\\text{mod}~5)$ of order $5$, and let's choose the generator $2$. The exponential map, which we'll call $\\xi$ is:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\xi : \\mathbb{Z}_5 &\\rightarrow \\mathbb{G}\\\\\na &\\mapsto 2\\cdot a\\quad\\text{mod}~5\n\\end{align*}\n\nTo test if this is true:\n\n<center>\n\n|     $\\mathbb{Z}_5$         |         $\\mathbb{G}$    |\n|:---:|:----------------------------------------------:|\n| $a$ |       $\\xi(a)=2\\cdot a\\quad\\text{mod}~5$       |\n| $0$ |             $\\xi(0)=2\\cdot 0 = 0$              |\n| $1$ |             $\\xi(1)=2\\cdot 1 = 2$              |\n| $2$ |             $\\xi(2)=2\\cdot 2 = 4$              |\n| $3$ | $\\xi(3)=2\\cdot 3 = 6\\equiv 1\\quad\\text{mod}~5$ |\n| $4$ | $\\xi(4)=2\\cdot 4 = 8\\equiv 3\\quad\\text{mod}~5$ |\n\n</center>\n\n\nAnother example: take the finite cyclic abelian group $\\mathbb{G}:=(\\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}, \\cdot~\\text{mod}~7)$ of order $6$, and let's choose the generator $3$. The exponential map, which we'll call $\\xi$ is:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\xi : \\mathbb{Z}_6 &\\rightarrow \\mathbb{G}\\\\\na &\\mapsto 3^a\\quad\\text{mod}~7\n\\end{align*}\n\nTo test if this is true:\n\n<center>\n\n|     $\\mathbb{Z}_6$         |         $\\mathbb{G}$     |\n|:---:|:-----------------------------------------------:|\n| $a$ |         $\\xi(a) = 3^a\\quad\\text{mod}~7$         |\n| $0$ |               $\\xi(0)= 3^0 = 1$                 |\n| $1$ |               $\\xi(1)= 3^1 = 3$                 |\n| $2$ |               $\\xi(2)= 3^2 = 2$                 |\n| $3$ |   $\\xi(3)=3^3 = 27 \\equiv 6\\quad\\text{mod}~7$   |\n| $4$ |   $\\xi(4)=3^4 = 81 \\equiv 4\\quad\\text{mod}~7$   |\n| $5$ | $\\xi(5)=3^5 = 243 = 8\\equiv 5\\quad\\text{mod}~7$ |\n\n</center>\n\nThe exponential map allows to perform so-called _\"calculations in the exponent\"_. For the previous example,  that we want to compute $5\\cdot 6\\cdot 3\\quad\\text{mod}~7$. We can do it two ways:\n\n\n### Pairings\n\nA pairing map takes elements from a group $\\mathbb{G}_1$ and elements from a group $\\mathbb{G}_2$ and returns an element of a group $\\mathbb{G}_T$. Let's define the pairing $e$, and a pair $(a,b)\\mid a\\in\\mathbb{G_1}, b\\in\\mathbb{G}_2$:\n\n\\begin{align*}\ne : \\mathbb{G}_1\\times\\mathbb{G}_2 &\\rightarrow \\mathbb{G}_T\\\\\n(a,b) &\\mapsto e(a,b)\n\\end{align*}\n\nA pairing is said to be **bilinear** if for all $g_1,g'_1\\in\\mathbb{G}_1$ and $g_2,g'_2\\in\\mathbb{G}_2$, it is satisfied that:\n\n\\begin{align*}\ne(g_1\\oplus g'_1,g_2) &= e(g_1,g_2)\\oplus e(g'_1,g_2)\\\\\ne(g_1,g_2\\oplus g'_2) &= e(g_1,g_2)\\oplus e(g_1,g'_2)\n\\end{align*}\n\nA pairing is said to be **non-degenerate** if for all $g_1\\in\\mathbb{G}_1$ and $g_2\\in\\mathbb{G}_2$, it is satisfied that:\n\n$$e(g_1,g_2)=\\boldsymbol{1}_{\\mathbb{G}_T}\\Rightarrow \\boldsymbol{1}_{\\mathbb{G}_1}\\quad\\text{or}\\quad\\boldsymbol{1}_{\\mathbb{G}_2}$$\n\nIn other words, if the pairing of two elements of $\\mathbb{G}_1$ and $\\mathbb{G}_2$ is the neutral element of $\\mathbb{G}_T$, then at least one of the elements of $\\mathbb{G}_1$ or $\\mathbb{G}_2$ must be the neutral element of their respective group.\n\nAn example for a pairing is taking all the groups as the set of integers $\\mathbb{Z}_p$ with the binary operation addition $+$ and the pairing $e$ as:\n\n\\begin{align*}\ne : \\mathbb{Z}\\times\\mathbb{Z} &\\rightarrow \\mathbb{Z}\\\\\n(a,b) &\\mapsto a\\cdot b\n\\end{align*}\n\nIt is easy to see that:\n\n\\begin{align*}\ne(a + b, c) &= (a + b)\\cdot c = a\\cdot c + b\\cdot c = e(a, c) + e(b, c)\\\\\ne(a,b) &= 0 \\Rightarrow a = 0 \\quad\\text{or}\\quad b = 0\n\\end{align*}\n\nboth hold.\n\n\n### Rings\n\nWe will be focusing on something more specifically called commutative rings. A Ring $R$ is a tuple $(R,\\oplus,\\otimes)$ where $R$ is a set and $\\oplus$ and $\\otimes$ are binary operations that satisfy the following properties:\n\n- $(R,\\oplus)$ is an Abelian Group\n- Commutativity: $\\forall a,b\\in R, a\\otimes b=b\\otimes a$\n- Associativity: $\\forall a,b,c\\in R, (a\\otimes b)\\otimes c=a\\otimes(b\\otimes c)$\n- Distributivity: $\\forall a,b,c\\in R, (a\\oplus b)\\otimes c=(a\\otimes c)\\oplus(b\\otimes c)$\n- Identity element: $\\exists e\\in R, \\forall a\\in R, a\\otimes e=e\\otimes a=a$. $e$ is called the identity element. Sometimes it is also denoted by a **bold** \"one\": $\\boldsymbol{1}$. In this case, the identity element for $\\oplus$ can be denoted by a **bold** \"zero\": $\\boldsymbol{0}$.\n\nExample, the set of integers $\\mathbb{Z}$ with the binary operations $+$ (addition) and $\\cdot$ (product; multiplication) is a Ring. The identity element for $+$ is $0$ and the identity element for $\\cdot$ is $1$.\n\n### Fields & Galois Fields\n\nThe final algebraic structure we'll see are Fields. A Field $\\mathbb{F}$ is a tuple $(F,\\oplus,\\otimes)$ where $F$ is a set and $\\oplus$ and $\\otimes$ are binary operations that satisfy the following properties:\n\n- $(F,\\oplus,\\otimes)$ is a Ring\n- $\\forall a\\in F\\setminus\\{0\\}, \\exists a^{-1}\\in F, a\\otimes a^{-1}=a^{-1}\\otimes a=e$. $a^{-1}$ is called the inverse element of $a$.\n\nGalois Fields (also known as Finite Fields) are a special kind of Field, where the set $F$ is finite. The order of the field is the number of elements in the set $F$, and is usually denoted by $\\left|\\mathbb{F}\\right|$. We are going to use what are known as Prime Fields, which are build by means of $\\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z}$ with the binary operations $+$ (addition) and $\\cdot$ (product; multiplication) under modulo $p$, where $p\\in\\mathbb{P}$. These special fields are denoted as $\\mathbb{F}_p$.\n\nWhat if $\\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}$, where $n\\notin\\mathbb{P}$?_\n\nIn that case, we would have a Ring, but not a Field, because not every arbitrary element of $a\\in\\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}\\setminus\\{0\\}$ has an inverse $a^{-1}$ in the set. For example, let's take $\\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$ with the binary operation $\\cdot$ (product; multiplication) under modulo $6$. Since $\\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}=\\{0,1,2,3,4,5\\}$, let's construct the multiplication table:\n\n<center>\n\n| $\\cdot$ | $0$ | $1$ | $2$ | $3$ | $4$ | $5$ |\n|:-------:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|\n|   $0$   | $0$ | $0$ | $0$ | $0$ | $0$ | $0$ |\n|   $1$   | $0$ | $1$ | $2$ | $3$ | $4$ | $5$ |\n|   $2$   | $0$ | $2$ | $4$ | $0$ | $2$ | $4$ |\n|   $3$   | $0$ | $3$ | $0$ | $3$ | $0$ | $3$ |\n|   $4$   | $0$ | $4$ | $2$ | $0$ | $4$ | $2$ |\n|   $5$   | $0$ | $5$ | $4$ | $3$ | $2$ | $1$ |\n\n</center>\n\nNotice that there are rows/columns (besides $0$) that do not have a single entry that equals 1? For example, $2$, $3$ and $4$. This means that only $1$ and $5$ have a multiplicative inverse in $\\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$, while the rest of the elements do not. Therefore, $\\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$ is not a Field.\n\n## Polynomials\n\nA polynomial is an expression consisting of variables (also called indeterminates) and coefficients, that involves only the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and non-negative integer exponents of variables. An example of a polynomial of a single indeterminate $x$ is $x^2 - 4x + 7$. When talking about polynomials, one refers to the set of polynomials with coefficients and values that \"live\" in the field of real numbers $\\mathbb{R}$ (embeded with the binary operations $+$ (addition) and $\\cdot$ (product; multiplication)). This set is denoted as $\\mathbb{R}[x]$. For example, the polynomial $x^2 - 2$ is an element of $\\mathbb{R}[x]$.\n\nWe can define polynomials over any field $\\mathbb{F}$, and denote the set of polynomials with coefficients and values that \"live\" in $\\mathbb{F}$ as $\\mathbb{F}[x]$. For example, the polynomial $x^2 - 2$ is also an element of $\\mathbb{F}_5[x]$.\n\nThe field over which we construct the polynomials greatly affects the properties of the polynomials. Example, let's take the polynomial $x^2 - 2$.\n- If we are working with $\\mathbb{R}[x]$, then this polynomial has two roots: $\\sqrt{2}$ and $-\\sqrt{2}$, because $x^2 - 2 = (x - \\sqrt{2})(x + \\sqrt{2})$.\n- If we are working with $\\mathbb{F}_5[x]$, then this polynomial has no roots, because $\\pm\\sqrt{2}$ are not elements of $\\mathbb{F}_5$.\n\nSo, $x^2 - 2$ is an irreducible polynomial in $\\mathbb{F}_5[x]$, but not in $\\mathbb{R}[x]$.\n\nAnother example: the polynomial $x^2 + 1$.\n- If we are working with $\\mathbb{R}[x]$, then this polynomial has no roots, because $x^2 + 1 = (x + i)(x - i)$, where $i$ is the imaginary unit, and $i$ is not an element of $\\mathbb{R}$.\n- If we are working with $\\mathbb{C}[x]$, then this polynomial has two roots: $\\pm i$.\n- If we are working with $\\mathbb{F}_5[x]$, then this polynomial has two roots: $2$ and $3$, because $x^2 + 1 = (x - 2)(x - 3)$.\n\nRemember that in $\\mathbb{F}_5[x]$, all operations are done under modulo $5$. So, let's expand $(x - 2)(x - 3)$:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n(x - 2)(x - 3) &= x^2 - 3x - 2x + 6\\\\\n&= x^2 - 5x + 6\\\\\n&\\equiv x^2 + 1\\quad\\text{mod}~5\n\\end{align*}",
